        "description": "So you want to learn JavaScript? In this Web Learning Platfrom we will start at the very beginning and cover everything about the language that a beginner needs to know. Maybe you have never programmed anything before, or maybe you are coming to JavaScript from another language. Whatever your situation, we will go through everything you need to get up and running with one of the most popular and dynamic languages in use today.As you follow along with almost six hours of content you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, from variables, data types, operators, functions, and keywords, to how to control program flow and work with strings. You will even learn more advanced techniques such as prototypal inheritance, regular expressions, closures, and mixins",

        "description": "In this course, Web Learning Platfrom instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you everything you need to know in order to write object-oriented JavaScript. You will learn how to use the different creational patterns, such as factory functions, constructor functions, and classes. You will also learn how to use the new tools in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to implement truly private encapsulation in your code. Finally, you will also learn the different JavaScript inheritance patterns for reusing existing code. At the end of this course, you will apply everything you have learned to write a custom event system and a simple toolbar component. Throughout the course, Jeremy will demonstrate the new syntax in ES6 and also the patterns for achieving object orientation that have been used in older versions of JavaScript",

You will learn about pure functions, side-effects and declarative style while building a small functional utility library. The project will demonstrate how Underscore or Lodash functions like filter, map, and reduce really work. Focused on practical understanding over philosophy, this is a great basic intro to functional programming that will prepare you for deeper exploration.",

        "description": "JavaScript ES6 (more properly known as ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015) represents the biggest change to JavaScript in the last 20 years. JavaScript is the language of the web, and ES6 is a major improvement for web developers, adding much-needed features such as classes, promises, arrow functions, generators, string templates and many others. Browser support is growing, and transpilation tools such as Babel allow you to get started coding in ES6 today. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will help you sharpen and update your JavaScript skills by learning some of the most important additions that ES6 brings to the language. Cutting-edge web development practices are increasingly relying on ES6, so knowledge of the new syntax is becoming more and more necessary. Not only that, but programming in ES6 is just more fun. So let’s get started!",
